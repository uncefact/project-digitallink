# Core Project

The **Core Project** is an essential component within the Lerna monorepository architecture of our application. It serves as the foundational layer, providing core functionalities and shared modules that are crucial for the entire project.

The `src/` directory houses the source code of the provider project, containing modules, services, or resources that are shared or utilized by other parts of the application.
